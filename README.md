`gcviz` is a terminal UI (TUI) visualizer for Go GC behavior: GC cycles, STW pauses, heap live/goal dynamics, and GC pacer signals, live.

It is meant for "fast feedback" during performance work:

- spot bad STW spikes (p99/max) under load
- see GC rate changes across runs
- see heap live approaching heap goal and getting more aggressive pacing
- compare two runs via snapshots (`diff`)

## How It Works

`gcviz` has two data sources:

- `run` (primary): starts your binary, ensures `GODEBUG` contains `gctrace=1,gcpacertrace=1`, parses the target `stderr`.
- `attach` (secondary): polls an HTTP endpoint that exports `runtime/metrics` in a `gcviz`-friendly JSON format (via `pkg/reporter`).

No code changes are required for `run`. For `attach`, you add a small HTTP endpoint to the target service.

## Quickstart (1 minute)

![gcviz launch](docs/assets/demo_launch.readme.gif)

Prereqs: Go 1.22+, a reasonably sized terminal.

### 1) Try the built-in demo workload

From source (no install):

```bash
go run ./cmd/gcviz lab churn
```

Or via Makefile:

```bash
make lab-churn
```

Open in-app help any time: `?` / `h` / `f1`.

### 2) Run on your binary (step-by-step)

1. Build your target app as a binary:

```bash
go build -o ./myapp ./cmd/myapp
```

2. Run it under observation (note the `--` separator for passing args to your program):

```bash
go run ./cmd/gcviz run ./myapp -- --your-flag value
```

3. In the UI:

- press `?` to see all hotkeys
- press `space` to pause/resume
- when paused, use `left/right` (and `home/end`) to scrub history
- press `s` to write a snapshot to `tmp/snapshots` (by default)

If you want to use `gcviz` as a CLI, install it once and run `gcviz ...` directly (see below).

## Install & CLI Usage

Install the `gcviz` CLI into your `GOBIN`:

```bash
go install github.com/timur-developer/gcviz/cmd/gcviz@latest
```

After that you can use `gcviz` as a normal CLI:

```bash
gcviz lab churn
```

```bash
gcviz run ./path/to/your-binary -- --your-flag value
```

```bash
gcviz attach http://127.0.0.1:8080/gcviz/metrics
```

```bash
gcviz diff ./a.json ./b.json
```

Built-in help:

```bash
gcviz --help
gcviz run --help
```

## Usage

### run (run your binary under observation)

Run your Go program under observation:

```bash
gcviz run ./path/to/your-binary
```

This mode is intended for checking how Go's garbage collector behaves in your project during a real run.

`run` works with a compiled binary (not a `.go` file), so build your program first, then pass the resulting executable path to `gcviz`.

Need flags or want to pass args/flags to your program? See **Configuration**.

From source (no install):

```bash
go run ./cmd/gcviz run ./path/to/your-binary
```

Makefile shortcut:

```bash
make run TARGET=./path/to/your-binary
```

### lab (built-in demo workloads)

Built-in demo presets:

```bash
gcviz lab alloc
gcviz lab churn
gcviz lab idle
gcviz lab spike
```

What the presets mean (synthetic workloads):

- `alloc`: steady small/medium allocations with some retention (heap live gradually grows; stable GC cadence)
- `churn`: repeated large bursts with short retention (frequent GC cycles; good for stressing STW/pacer)
- `idle`: mostly idle with occasional bursts (sporadic GC activity; useful to see low-frequency behavior)
- `spike`: light background traffic + periodic heavy waves (visible spikes in heap/STW patterns)

### attach (connect to a runtime/metrics HTTP endpoint)

Attach to a running service that exposes `runtime/metrics` in `gcviz` JSON format.

1. Add `pkg/reporter` to your service:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/timur-developer/gcviz/pkg/reporter"
)

func main() {
	rep := reporter.New()

	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.Handle(rep.Path(), rep.Handler())

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux))
}
```

2. Attach:

```bash
gcviz attach http://127.0.0.1:8080/gcviz/metrics
```

Notes (attach mode):

- the endpoint payload is based on `runtime/metrics`, so values differ from `run` mode
- the target process environment (`GOGC`, `GOMEMLIMIT`, `GODEBUG`) is not available; UI shows `n/a`

### diff (compare two snapshot files)

Compare two snapshots:

```bash
gcviz diff ./a.json ./b.json
```

What `diff` prints:

- a short summary for snapshot A and B (`gc_cycles_total`, `heap_live_mb`, `stw_p50/p99/max_us`)
- delta (B-A) for `heap_live_mb` and STW window stats

## What You See (Metrics & Panels)

`gcviz` keeps a sliding window of recent GC events (`--window-size`, default: 200) and shows both raw per-cycle values and derived stats over that window.

### Current Values

- `GC cycles total`: current GC cycle number
- `last STW (us)`: last cycle STW pause (sweep term + mark term, converted to microseconds)
- `heap live (MB)` / `heap goal (MB)`: live heap and current goal
- `heap: live/goal`: a compact live-vs-goal indicator

### Information (window stats)

- `max STW (us)`: max STW over the visible window
- `gc`: rate as `GCs/min` and/or average GC interval
- `stw`: bad STW count/percent (based on thresholds) and forced GC count
- `time since last GC`, `uptime`
- `stw thresholds`: `warn` / `bad` (see Configuration)
- snapshot status and snapshot directory
- env context (`GOGC`, `GOMEMLIMIT`, `GODEBUG`) in `run`/`lab` (not available in `attach`)

### Charts

- **Heap live over time (MB)**: time-series of heap live
- **STW p50/p99/max over time (us)**: time-series derived from the sliding window
- **STW per cycle**: per-cycle bar chart; labels can show STW or heap live (toggle with `l`)

### Cycle Details (selected GC event)

For the currently selected cycle (live cursor, or scrubbed history when paused):

- GC #, time since start, forced
- STW total (us) + breakdown: sweep term / mark term
- heap (MB): start/end and live/goal
- gc cpu (%)
- pacer signals (when available): assist ratio, assist workers, pages swept

## Controls

![gcviz features](docs/assets/demo_features.readme.gif)

Full list of hotkeys is always available in the in-app Help (`?` / `h` / `f1`).

Core:

- `?` / `h` / `f1` toggle Help
- `q` / `ctrl+c` quit
- `space` pause/resume live updates
- `left` / `right` scrub history when paused
- `home` / `end` jump to first/last event when paused
- `s` write a snapshot

Layout and labels:

- `g` toggle layout (spaced/tight)
- `l` toggle STW bar labels mode (GC+STW -> GC+Heap -> GC-only)

Charts:

- `z` switch focused chart (Heap/STW). Zoom/pan applies to the focused chart.
- `+` / `-` zoom Y for focused chart
- `0` reset Y zoom/pan for focused chart
- `shift+up` / `shift+down` pan Y for focused chart
- `[` / `]` zoom time span (X axis): all -> 1h -> 15m -> 5m -> 1m (and back)
- `r` reset focus, zoom/pan, and time span

## Configuration

Global flags (and their env overrides):

- `--window-size` (`GCVIZ_WINDOW_SIZE`) samples kept in memory (default: 200)
- `--snapshot-path` (`GCVIZ_SNAPSHOT_PATH`) snapshot directory (default: `tmp/snapshots`)
- `--exit-snapshot` (`GCVIZ_EXIT_SNAPSHOT`) write a snapshot on exit (default: true)
- `--no-alt-screen` (`GCVIZ_NO_ALT_SCREEN`) disable alt screen buffer
- `--stw-warn-us` (`GCVIZ_STW_WARN_US`) STW warning threshold (default: 200)
- `--stw-bad-us` (`GCVIZ_STW_BAD_US`) STW bad threshold (default: 1000)

Mode-specific env vars:

- `GCVIZ_RUN_TARGET`
- `GCVIZ_ATTACH_URL`, `GCVIZ_POLL_INTERVAL`
- `GCVIZ_LAB_PRESET`
- `GCVIZ_DIFF_A`, `GCVIZ_DIFF_B`

All flags can be provided via their `GCVIZ_*` env equivalents listed above.

### Flags & Argument Passing

Global flags (like `--window-size`, `--stw-bad-us`) go before the subcommand because they apply to all modes.

In `run` mode, `--` separates `gcviz` arguments from the target program arguments. Everything after `--` is passed to your binary unchanged.

Template:

```bash
gcviz [global flags] run <target-binary> -- [target args...]
```

Example:

```bash
gcviz --window-size 500 --stw-bad-us 2000 run ./path/to/your-binary -- --your-flag value
```

## Snapshots

- Default directory: `tmp/snapshots`
- Manual snapshot: press `s`
- Exit snapshot: enabled by default; skipped if a manual snapshot was created recently

What a snapshot contains:

- current values (`gc_cycles_total`, `last_stw_us`, `heap_live_mb`, `heap_goal_mb`)
- window stats (`stw_p50_us`, `stw_p99_us`, `stw_max_us`)
- the list of recent GC events (the same window used by the UI), including parsed pacer fields when available

Snapshots are plain JSON files. They are useful for sharing, tracking regressions, and comparing two runs with `gcviz diff`.

## Make Targets

`make help` prints all targets. Most common ones:

- `make ci`: run lint + tests + build
- `make lint`: run `golangci-lint`
- `make test`: run `go test ./...`
- `make build`: run `go build ./...` (sanity check)
- `make install`: install `gcviz` into your Go bin directory
- `make lab` (or `make lab-churn`, etc.): run demo workloads
- `make run TARGET=... ARGS="-- ..."`: run your binary under observation
- `make attach URL=...`: attach to a running service (default URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/gcviz/metrics`)
- `make diff A=... B=...`: compare two snapshot files

Maintainers:

- `make testbin`: rebuild embedded `lab` binaries for all supported OS/arch
- `make release-snapshot`: local GoReleaser build (`--snapshot --clean`)

## Notes / FAQ

- `attach` mode cannot see the target process env (`GOGC`, `GOMEMLIMIT`, `GODEBUG`), so UI shows `n/a` for these fields.
- If you see no updates, your program might simply not be hitting GC cycles yet (try a workload that allocates more, or use `lab churn`).
- If your terminal behaves oddly, try `--no-alt-screen` (or `GCVIZ_NO_ALT_SCREEN=true`).
- Very small STW values may display as 0 due to `gctrace` formatting.
